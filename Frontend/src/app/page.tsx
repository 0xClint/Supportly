          Customer support is often expensive, unreliable, or hard to set up for
          website owners, especially when trying to personalize answers based on
          their unique data. Supportly solves this problem by providing a
          plug-and-play AI support system where users can upload their own data
          and pay only when customers ask questions using x402 microtransactions
          in USDC. This makes smart, personalized support affordable and easy to
          use. Under the hood, AI RAG is used to ensure that responses are
          accurate and based on the userâ€™s uploaded content.
